# Mortality Status Detection Analysis

A project on a `classification` problem.

## About the dataset:
The `icu.csv` dataset contains the following information about 20,000 patients in ICU:
- Patient_ID
- Mortality
- Age
- Race
- SBP
- DBP
- MAP
- Temperature
- Respiration

You can download the `icu.csv` file from the `data` folder.

## Aim of the project:
To perform the following tasks:

- Do `exploratory data analysis` to identify variables that are significant predictors to predict the mortality status of patients.
- Perform `classification` and build a model to predict the mortality status of patients when values for the identified predictors are given as an input.
- Use `regularization` methods to address overfitting/underfitting issues in the model.
- Discuss the shortcomings of the model.
- Identify if there are any biases in the dataset and suggest how to overcome them.

## Instructions to view the analysis:

1. Run the R markdown file:

- Download the `ICU-MortalityStatusDetectionAnalysis.Rmd` file.
- Set directory with the `ICU-MortalityStatusDetectionAnalysis.Rmd` file as the working directory.
- Download the `icu.csv` dataset within the `data` folder in the working directory.
- Run the `ICU-MortalityStatusDetectionAnalysis.Rmd` file.

2. Download and view the `ICU-MortalityStatusDetectionAnalysis.html` file.
